# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a command-line interface (CLI) service to the attractap-touch firmware that listens for commands via serial communication and executes them. The CLI service provides a standardized way to interact with the firmware programmatically, enabling external tools and scripts to query device information and control device functionality.

The CLI service implements a simple command-response protocol over serial communication, making it easy for external applications to integrate with the attractap-touch devices for configuration, monitoring, and control purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer or system administrator, I want to send commands to the attractap-touch device via serial communication, so that I can programmatically query device information and control device functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command is sent via serial in the format "CMND <GET | SET> <action> <payload>" THEN the system SHALL parse and execute the command
2. WHEN a command is executed THEN the system SHALL respond with "RESP <action> <answer>" format
3. WHEN a command is malformed THEN the system SHALL respond with an error message in the standard response format
4. WHEN multiple commands are sent THEN the system SHALL process them sequentially in order received

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to query the firmware version via CLI, so that I can verify which version is running on the device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the command "CMND GET firmware.version" is sent THEN the system SHALL respond with "RESP firmware.version <version_string>"
2. WHEN the firmware version is requested THEN the system SHALL return the current firmware version as defined in the build configuration
3. WHEN the firmware version command is executed THEN the response SHALL be sent within 100ms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want commands and responses to follow a consistent format, so that I can easily parse and process them programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any command is sent THEN it SHALL follow the format "CMND <GET | SET> <action> <payload>"
2. WHEN any response is sent THEN it SHALL follow the format "RESP <action> <answer>"
3. WHEN a command includes a payload THEN the payload SHALL be separated by a single space
4. WHEN a command does not require a payload THEN the payload SHALL be omitted
5. WHEN commands or responses are transmitted THEN they SHALL be single-line messages ending with '\n'

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI service to integrate seamlessly with the existing firmware architecture, so that it doesn't interfere with normal device operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI service is running THEN it SHALL NOT interfere with the main device functionality (display, touch, NFC, WiFi)
2. WHEN the CLI service processes commands THEN it SHALL NOT block the main loop execution
3. WHEN the CLI service is initialized THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing service architecture
4. WHEN the device is operating normally THEN the CLI service SHALL consume minimal system resources

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI service to handle errors gracefully, so that invalid commands don't crash the device or leave it in an unstable state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid command format is received THEN the system SHALL respond with "RESP error invalid_command_format"
2. WHEN an unknown action is requested THEN the system SHALL respond with "RESP error unknown_action"
3. WHEN a command execution fails THEN the system SHALL respond with "RESP error <specific_error_message>"
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the CLI service SHALL continue to accept and process subsequent commands
5. WHEN serial communication errors occur THEN the CLI service SHALL attempt to recover gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI service to be extensible, so that new commands can be easily added in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new commands need to be added THEN the CLI service architecture SHALL support easy extension
2. WHEN command handlers are implemented THEN they SHALL follow a consistent interface pattern
3. WHEN the CLI service is designed THEN it SHALL separate command parsing from command execution
4. WHEN new command types are added THEN existing commands SHALL continue to work without modification
